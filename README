* or hardware interrup like power button
* at start bios load some address pointers at the start of memory (0x0)
* and they refer to location of functions that know how to deal with screen for
* example
* on wiki you can find out that interrup related to screen is int 0x10
* to print we need to use tele-type service to use it ah need to have the

/*
* mov need the absolute location of memory but labels

*/


/*
* it's inconvient to always calculate the exact location by adding 0x7c00
* so we can tell the assembler [nasm] to work relative to some address
